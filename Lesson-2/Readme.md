Welcome back.

In lesson-2 we will start with Javascript.

You will learn, how DOM objects can be activated and deactivated with a mouse-click.
Further we'll see how to manipulate stuff like the background color of objects from
Javascript.

A short introduction and example to Javascript Event Handlers is included too.

As a special gimmick it is shown how to manipulate the font-size property with a HTML5 Range Control in realtime.

As a starting point and reference to lesson-1 and lesson-2 you can find the completed files 
from lesson-1 and lesson-2 in this directory.

Have fun.

Any questions? Feel free to contact me.
