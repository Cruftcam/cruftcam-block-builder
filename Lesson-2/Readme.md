Welcome back.

In lesson-2 we will start with Javascript.

You will learn, how DOM objects can be activated and deactivated with a mouse-click.
Further we'll see how to manipulate stuff like the background color of objects from
Javascript.

As a starting point and reference to lesson-1 you can find the completed files 
from lesson-1 in this directory.
