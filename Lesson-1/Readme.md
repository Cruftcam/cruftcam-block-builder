Welcome to this tutorial.

Here you can find the starting files for the cruftcam-block-builder tutorial.

index.html
content.css
content.js

These files are the starting point for the video tutorial that can be found on YouTube.
The goal of this tutorial series is to learn and understand how a website builder works.

Please keep in mind that this is mainly a Javascript tutorial. It is not intended to
build another fully functional website builder or any other kind of product or library.

In the first lesson we will add some controls to a simple sticky footer. 
Then some static content is added to the first block. This will be a header textblock
and a block with a subheader area.

From there we'll examine, how we can manipulate HTML and CSS properties and DOM objects
dynamically using Javascript.

This is an open educational project anybody can join. 

Feel free to contact me, if you have any questions.
